- progress bar, or X/180 type of progress indication, so you know how much more you need to mash
- remove dormant games from state
  - store game last updated times
  - in initNewGameAndPerson, also loop through state["games"] and remove any with "lastUpdateDatetime" too long ago
- consider if the server needs to be the thing that launches the classifierProcess, when hosted in production
  - perhaps not, if the production environment is some multi-container thing like kubernetes or a Docker thing with a docker-compose and that config is what specifies the multiple processes to begin
- classification experimentation
  - see if can get confidence for the current guess
  - try neural net instead of a LinearSVC where I have to decide the features (rn I use tf-idf, meaning substring frequency)


Notes:
- https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html shows how to get
a matrix of features from a list of string samples, where the features are frequencies of n-grams (like "fk;").
